# 「 ✦ FORUM ✦ 」

Forum is a program which allows members to hold discussions online. The discussion is started by one member by posting a topic and other members reply.

## ‧₊˚✧ Description ✧˚₊‧

This project utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to develop an online forum.

    Model: The database that stores all forum information.
    View: The front-end that allows users to interact with the forum.
    Controller: The back-end that handles business logic and interactions between the model and the view.

We also integrate advanced technologies such as View SQL for complex queries and middleware to enhance request handling and data security.
